One thing I've noticed during my first month at ThoughtWorks is that contrary to my
own anecdotal experience, the majority of coders are not in fact queer. Another,
far more surprising thing, is that those programmers who are queer seem to be
relatively invisible - or, at least, their queerness is.

Even at such a progressive company as ThoughtWorks... I've noticed that while I have
felt welcomed, accepted, and like I belong there, I have yet to find people *like me*.
At least, in some ways that I consider core to my identity and who I am. Some of
that is probably down to my own quintessential weirdness. But I feel that it
seems to speak more to a lack of visibility, than a lack of diversity.

Perhaps queerness and coding simply don't intersect much - so while I know plenty
of coders who are queer, 'queer coders' as a category doesn't hold much weight.
This would explain why, in attempt to find worthy causes for my new book budget,
I was unable to find any books out there that spoke to an intersectionality of
queerness and technology (if you know of any, dear reader, please hit me up).

I have to wonder if I will "fade" over time, become merely a programmer who is
queer/trans/pan/poly, instead of a "queer coder". Time will tell.
